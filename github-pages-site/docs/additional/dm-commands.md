## Available DM Commands

### clear-last

The `clear-last` command deletes the most recent message sent by InfiniBot in your DMs.

**Usage:**

2. The bot will delete its most recent message
3. You'll receive a confirmation message that auto-deletes after a few seconds

**Example:**
```
You: clear-last
InfiniBot (scheduled for auto-deletion): Cleared Last Message
```

### /opt-into-dms

The `/opt-into-dms` slash command allows you to opt into receiving DM notifications from InfiniBot.

**Usage:**
- Use `/opt-into-dms` in a DM with InfiniBot
- You'll receive notifications for level-ups, birthday wishes, strike notices, and permission errors

### /opt-out-of-dms

The `/opt-out-of-dms` slash command allows you to opt out of receiving DM notifications from InfiniBot.

**Usage:**
- Use `/opt-out-of-dms` in a DM with InfiniBot
- You'll stop receiving all automated DM notifications

## Managing DM Notifications

There are multiple ways to manage your DM notification preferences:

### Method 1: Slash Commands (Recommended)
- **Opt in:** Use `/opt-into-dms` in a DM with InfiniBot
- **Opt out:** Use `/opt-out-of-dms` in a DM with InfiniBot

### Method 2: Profile Settings
1. Use `/profile` in any server with InfiniBot
2. Click on the **Settings** button
3. Click the **Direct Messages** button
4. Click **Enable** or **Disable** to manage DM notifications

## What DM Notifications Include

When DM notifications are enabled, InfiniBot will send you:
- **Level-up notifications** - When you reach a new level in any server
- **Birthday wishes** - Happy birthday messages on your special day
- **Strike notices** - Notifications when you receive moderation strikes
- **Permission error alerts** - When InfiniBot can't perform actions due to missing permissions

When DM notifications are disabled, you won't receive any of these automated messages.

## Privacy Considerations

- InfiniBot only responds to specific commands in DMs
- The bot doesn't read or analyze other messages you send
- Your DM interaction with InfiniBot is private

## Troubleshooting

If DM commands aren't working:
1. Ensure you have DMs enabled for members of the server
2. Check that your privacy settings allow DMs from bot users
3. Try sending the command exactly as written (lowercase, no spaces)

For additional help with DM commands, contact the support server.
