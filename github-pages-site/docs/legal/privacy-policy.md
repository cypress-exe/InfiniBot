## Overview

InfiniBot is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the types of information collected from users of InfiniBot, how that information is used, and how it is protected.

## Information Collected

InfiniBot collects certain information from users, including:
- User IDs
- Server IDs
- Channel IDs
- Role IDs
- Message data and content (when Logging is enabled by server administrators)

It's important to note that Discord IDs are public identification numbers that Discord assigns to every user/channel/server. These IDs are publicly accessible in Discord's developer mode and do not reveal any personal information about you beyond what is already available on Discord. These IDs are collected solely for the necessary functioning of InfiniBot's features.

## Use of Information

The information collected is used to:
- Provide and maintain InfiniBot services
- Communicate with users
- Comply with legal requirements

This information is NOT sold whatsoever nor shared with third parties, except as necessary to provide InfiniBot services, or as required by law. Message data collected through the Logging feature is stored securely and locally.

## Data Retention

Your information will be retained only for as long as necessary to provide InfiniBot services, or as required by law.

### Specific Retention Policies:

- **When you leave a server**: Any information relating to you directly, including your user ID, and any levels or preferences in the server will be deleted, with the exception of strikes (which may eventually expire depending on server configurations).

- **When InfiniBot is removed from a server**: Any information relating to the server directly will be deleted. This excludes individual member preferences.

- **Message data**: When Logging is enabled by server administrators, message content is stored securely for a maximum of 7 days or until the server has accumulated 1000 stored messages, whichever comes first. At that point, the oldest messages are automatically deleted.

- **InfiniBot-Generated Messages**: Includes embeds, reaction roles, and role messages. InfiniBot stores the message ID and owner ID to allow for editing. This information is stored indefinitely and is only deleted when the associated message is deleted, the channel is removed, or when InfiniBot leaves the server.

- **Data deletion requests**: You may request that your member preferences be deleted via the `/profile` → Settings → Delete My Data

If there is any data that is not removable by these processes, please contact the support team in the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mWgJJ8ZqwR) or via email (infinibotassistance@gmail.com).

## Security

Reasonable and appropriate measures are taken to protect the information collected from users of InfiniBot against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Using encryption where appropriate
- Limiting access to data to authorized personnel only
- Regular security assessments

However, no data transmission over the internet or electronic storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. By using InfiniBot, you acknowledge and accept these inherent risks.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. If material changes are made to this Privacy Policy, you will be notified by one or more of the following:
- Posting a notice in the [InfiniBot Support Server](https://discord.gg/mWgJJ8ZqwR)
- Updating the documentation
- Sending a message to servers

Your continued use of InfiniBot after changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of those changes.

## Legal Compliance

InfiniBot complies with all applicable laws regarding data collection, processing, and storage. The right is reserved to disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of InfiniBot
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the service
- Protect the personal safety of users of the service or the public

## Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, including:
- The right to access the data held about you
- The right to rectification of inaccurate data
- The right to deletion of your data (as outlined in the Data Retention policies)
