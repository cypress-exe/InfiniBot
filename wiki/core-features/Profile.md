# Profile

InfiniBot's Profile feature allows members to customize their personal settings and cards for a more personalized experience.

## Accessing Your Profile

Use the `/profile` command to open your personal profile settings menu.

## Profile Features

The profile menu contains several customization options:

### Level-Up Card

2. Choose from these options:
   - **Enable/Disable** - Toggle whether you use a level card
   - **Change Text** - Customize the title and description
   - **Change Color** - Select a color for your card

#### Customizing Level-Up Card Text

When changing text, you can use:
- **Title** - The main heading for your card

Example: "I reached level [level]! Awesome!"

### Settings

The settings section lets you adjust general profile preferences.

1. Click **Settings** in the profile menu
2. Options available:
   - **Toggle DMs** - Enable/disable direct messages from InfiniBot
   - **Reset All Settings** - Return all profile settings to default

## DM Notifications

InfiniBot may send you direct messages for:
- Level-up notifications
- Birthday wishes
- Important server announcements

You can opt out of these messages using the **Toggle DMs** option.

## Privacy Considerations

- Your profile information is only visible to you
- Level cards are visible to other members when you level up
- Join cards are visible to server members when you join a server that has enabled join cards

## Troubleshooting

If you're not receiving level-up or join card messages:
1. Check if you've disabled DMs in your profile settings
2. Verify that the server has level-up notifications or join cards enabled
3. Make sure your privacy settings allow messages from server members
