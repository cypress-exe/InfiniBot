# Introducing Our New Web Dashboard

We're thrilled to announce the launch of the InfiniBot Web Dashboard! This powerful new tool allows you to configure and manage all aspects of InfiniBot directly from your browser, without needing to use Discord commands.

## Key Features of the Dashboard

The new dashboard makes it easier than ever to customize InfiniBot for your server:

- **Visual Configuration**: Intuitive interface for setting up all of InfiniBot's features
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes take effect immediately in your Discord server
- **Server Statistics**: View detailed analytics about your server's activity
- **User-friendly Design**: Modern, responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- **Multi-server Management**: Manage InfiniBot across all your servers from one place

## Getting Started with the Dashboard

To access the dashboard, simply visit [dashboard.infinibot.com](https://dashboard.infinibot.com) and log in with your Discord account. You'll have immediate access to all servers where you have administrator permissions and InfiniBot is installed.

Check out our [Dashboard Guide](/docs/advanced/dashboard) for detailed instructions on using all the dashboard features.

## Future Improvements

This is just the beginning for our dashboard. We're already working on additional features including:

- Custom theme options
- Advanced analytics
- Role management interface
- Scheduled messages and announcements
- And much more!

We'd love to hear your feedback on the new dashboard. Join our [support server](https://discord.gg/infinibot) to share your thoughts and suggestions!
