# Reaction Roles

Reaction Roles allow server members to self-assign roles by reacting to messages with emojis.

{: .info }
Reaction roles are ideal for color roles, access roles, game roles, pronoun roles, or any other opt-in role categories.

## Types of Reaction Roles

InfiniBot offers three types of reaction role setups:

1. **Letter Reactions** - Uses letter emojis (üá¶, üáß, üá®, etc.)
2. **Number Reactions** - Uses number emojis (1Ô∏è‚É£, 2Ô∏è‚É£, 3Ô∏è‚É£, etc.)
3. **Custom Reactions** - Uses custom emojis of your choice

## Creating Reaction Roles

### Standard Reaction Roles (Letters or Numbers)

1. Use `/create reaction-role <Letters|Numbers> [mention-roles]`
2. Fill out the modal with:
   - **Title** - The title for your reaction role message
   - **Description** - Instructions or information about the roles
3. Select up to 10 roles from the dropdown menu
4. Click **Create**
5. InfiniBot will post the message with appropriate reactions

### Custom Reaction Roles

1. Use `/create custom-reaction-role <options> [mention-roles]`
2. For the options parameter, use the format: `"üëç = @Member, ü•∏ = @Gamer"`
3. Fill out the title and description in the modal
4. InfiniBot will post the message with your custom emoji reactions

## How Members Use Reaction Roles

Members can:
1. Find the reaction role message
2. React with the emoji corresponding to their desired role
3. The role will be instantly added/removed
4. Their reaction will be removed

### Why Are Reactions Removed?

Reactions are automatically removed to prevent synchronization issues. If multiple reaction role messages reference the same role, keeping reactions might cause inconsistencies, leading to confusion. By removing reactions, InfiniBot ensures that roles are assigned or removed accurately without conflicts.

## Managing Reaction Roles

Reaction role messages are tracked by InfiniBot. To manage them:

1. Find the reaction role message
2. Right-click the message
3. Select "Apps" and then "Options"
4. Choose "Edit" from the menu

### Editing Reaction Roles

Through the edit menu, you can:
1. Change the title or description of the reaction role message
2. Modify which roles are assigned by each reaction
3. Add new role options
4. Remove existing role options
5. Change which emojis are used

All changes take effect immediately, and members don't need to react again.

### Removing Reaction Roles

To remove reaction role functionality:
1. Simply delete the reaction role message
2. InfiniBot will automatically clean up

## Required Permissions

For reaction roles to work properly, InfiniBot needs:
- **Manage Roles** - To assign and remove roles
- **Add Reactions** - To add the initial reactions
- **Read Message History** - To track reactions

The bot's role must also be higher in the server hierarchy than any roles being assigned.

## Best Practices

- **Role Descriptions** - Include clear descriptions of what each role provides
- **Organization** - Group similar roles in the same message
- **Role Position** - Ensure InfiniBot's role is positioned above roles it needs to assign
- **Permission Check** - Verify InfiniBot can manage the roles you want to include

## Legacy Feature Note

Reaction Roles are a legacy feature. For a more modern alternative with enhanced UI and functionality, consider using [Role Messages](Role-Messages.md) instead.
