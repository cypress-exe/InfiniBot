## Logged Events

InfiniBot logs the following activities, categorized into three main types:

### Message Events

| Event Type         | Description                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Message Deletions  | Logs deleted messages, including content. |
| Message Edits      | Logs edited messages, showing before and after content. |

### Member Events

| Event Type         | Description                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Member Joins       | Logs when a member joins the server. |
| Member Leaves      | Logs when a member leaves the server. |
| Nickname Changes   | Tracks changes to member nicknames.  |
| Role Changes       | Logs updates to member roles.        |

### Moderation Events

| Event Type         | Description                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Member Timeouts    | Logs when a member is timed out.     |
| Member Bans/Unbans | Tracks bans and unbans of members.   |
| Member Kicks       | Logs when a member is kicked.        |

## Log Format

Each logged event contains:
- Event type and timestamp
- Affected user(s) or channel(s)
- Before/after information when applicable
- User who performed the action (when available)
- Attachments (for deleted/edited messages with images or files)

## Permissions Required

For full logging functionality, InfiniBot needs these permissions:
- **View Audit Log** - To determine who performed actions
- **Read Message History** - To capture message content
- **View Channels** - To monitor activities across channels

If InfiniBot is missing permissions, it will notify the server owner.

## Log Channel Security

It's recommended to:
1. Create a private channel visible only to moderators and administrators
2. Give InfiniBot full permissions in this channel
3. Configure the log channel by using `/set log-channel` in the desired channel or through the dashboard.

{: .tip }
To avoid frequent notifications, set the Log Channel's notification settings to "None" in Discord.

## Storage Limitations

InfiniBot has some limitations on log data retention:

- Deleted messages are only logged if they were sent while InfiniBot was online
- Message data older than 7 days or beyond the last 1000 messages is deleted
- InfiniBot logs for edited/deleted messages after the retention period will have reduced information
- Some information may be unavailable for specific actions
- For extensive history, consider enabling Discord's built-in audit log retention

For comprehensive details on how InfiniBot handles and retains message data, please review our [Privacy Policy]({% link docs/legal/privacy-policy.md %}).

## Tips for Effective Logging

- Set up a dedicated logging channel separate from your main admin channel and disable notifications for this channel to minimize distractions.
- Regularly check logs for unusual activity
- Keep the log channel organized (InfiniBot automatically uses embeds to help with this)
