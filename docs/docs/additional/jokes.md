## Using the Command

Use `/joke` to receive a randomized joke from InfiniBot's joke database.

## About the Feature

The jokes feature delivers a variety of humorous content, including:
- One-liners
- Riddles
- Puns
- Short jokes

Each joke is presented in an embedded message with:
- A title
- The joke content
- A punchline (for certain joke types) hidden in a spoiler tag

## Joke Format

Jokes appear in these formats:
- **Simple jokes** - Setup and punchline in the same text
- **Riddles** - Question with the answer hidden in a spoiler tag
- **Puns** - Wordplay jokes with entertaining titles

## Submitting Your Own Jokes

InfiniBot allows community members to submit their own jokes for possible inclusion in the joke database:

1. When you receive a joke, look for the **Submit a Joke** button below the joke message
2. Click the button to open the joke submission form
3. Enter a **Title** for your joke
4. Write the **Body** content (the main joke)
5. Optionally add a **Punchline** (will be displayed as a spoiler)
6. Submit the form

After submission:
1. Your joke is sent to the InfiniBot moderation team for review
2. Join the support server to receive DM updates about your joke's status
3. If approved, your joke will be added to the database
4. If rejected, you'll receive feedback about why

## Community Guidelines

While InfiniBot's jokes are designed to be appropriate for general audiences, server administrators should review the content to ensure it aligns with their community standards.

## Joke Content

The jokes in InfiniBot's database are:
- Family-friendly
- Non-controversial
- Free of offensive language or topics

If you ever encounter content you believe is inappropriate, please contact the support server.

## Enabling/Disabling the Feature

The jokes feature can be controlled through Discord's server settings:

1. Go to **Server Settings → Integrations → InfiniBot**
2. Find the `/joke` command in the list
3. Disable the command to prevent it from being used in your server
