# Motivational Statements

InfiniBot's Motivational Statements feature provides a humorous twist on traditional motivational content.

## Using the Command

Use `/motivational_statement` to receive a randomized "motivational" message.

## About the Feature

This lighthearted feature generates satirical anti-motivational statements that parody traditional motivational quotes. These statements are deliberately crafted to be absurd and should be taken as humor rather than actual advice.

## Important Disclaimer

As noted in the feature itself, these statements are **not** real motivational advice. They are intended to be humorous and are presented with a clear disclaimer to that effect.

For actual mental health support or genuine motivational resources, please consult professionals or reputable sources.

## Example Statements

Examples of the type of content this feature provides:
- "Don't stress over something today; it will be worse tomorrow."
- "If you think life is horrible right now, you're wrong. It will always get worse... count on it."

## Enabling/Disabling the Feature

The motivational statements feature can be controlled through Discord's server settings:

1. Go to **Server Settings → Integrations → InfiniBot**
2. Find the `/motivational_statement` command in the list
3. Disable the command to prevent it from being used in your server

## Server Appropriateness

Server administrators should consider whether this humor fits their community before enabling this feature. Some communities may prefer to keep it disabled if the humor doesn't align with their tone or values.
