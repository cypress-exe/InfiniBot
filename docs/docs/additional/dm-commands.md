# DM Commands
{: .no_toc }

InfiniBot offers several commands that can be used in direct messages (DMs).

{: .tip }
DM commands allow users to interact with InfiniBot privately, which can be helpful for managing personal settings or getting information without cluttering server channels.

## Available DM Commands

### clear-last

The `clear-last` command deletes the most recent message sent by InfiniBot in your DMs.

**Usage:**
1. Simply type `clear-last` in your DM with InfiniBot
2. The bot will delete its most recent message
3. You'll receive a confirmation message that auto-deletes after a few seconds

**Example:**
```
You: clear-last
InfiniBot (scheduled for auto-deletion): Cleared Last Message
```

## Opt-Out of DM Notifications

If you wish to stop receiving all DM notifications from InfiniBot:

1. Use `/profile` in any server with InfiniBot
2. Click on the **Settings** button
3. Click the **Direct Messages** button
4. Clicking **Disable** will DM notifications

This will prevent InfiniBot from sending you:
- Level-up notifications
- Birthday wishes
- Other automated messages

## Privacy Considerations

- InfiniBot only responds to specific commands in DMs
- The bot doesn't read or analyze other messages you send
- Your DM interaction with InfiniBot is private

## Troubleshooting

If DM commands aren't working:
1. Ensure you have DMs enabled for members of the server
2. Check that your privacy settings allow DMs from bot users
3. Try sending the command exactly as written (lowercase, no spaces)

For additional help with DM commands, contact the support server.
